# CPU Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to CPU Coding Challenge. The purpose of this challenge is for you to gain an insight of your understanding of computational thinking ideology as well as your familiarity with language Python. We recognize that it is impossible for us to cover anything but the superficial stuff during the weekly meeting due to time constraints, so we have carefully design the challenges to motivate you to learn through programming communities such as Stackoverflow. Independent online researching skill is crucial for you as a programmer, and we hope you would develop the skill through the course of completing this challenge. 

There are two parts of the challenge, Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. You may complete both of them if you want, but you may only choose one part of the challenge to submit upon completion. There is, of course, a prize associated with the completion of all challenges.

- Functional Programming
	- 10 questions
	- designed for beginners
	- 1 attendance point will be awarded if your code pass at least 6 test cases
	- 2 attendance points will be awarded if your code pass all 10 test cases
- Object Oriented Programming
	- 9 questions
	- designed for advanced programmers
	- 9 attendance points will be awarded if your code pass all 38 test cases

If you are not familiar with the concept of our attendance point system, here is the general outline:

- You get 1 attendance point for each club meeting you attend
- You may get 1-2 bonus attendance points for a particular club meeting, determined at the sole discretion of CPU cabinet.
- At the end of the year, you will receive a bluecard as a member of CPU if you have at least 5 attendance points
- At the end of the year, you will receive a bluecard as an officer of CPU if you have at least 18 attendance points
- Some minor adjustments may be applied to previous two rules based on the number of meetings we have of the school year.
- You need to have a Discord account to acquire attendance point.

## Submission
The challenge will be available at December 4, 6:30 p.m. It will be open until the first club meeting after the winter break. 

You may work on the challenge for however long you want. When you believe that you have done your best on the challenge, send your codes (`functional_challenge.py` or `oop_challenge.py`) to `pkqxdd#1358` on Discord or `jwang20@choate.edu`. If you choose to submit via email, you should use `CPU Coding Challenge Submission` as your email subject. You may submit your code only **once**.

The only measurement on how well you have performed in this challenge are the the number of test cases you passed, regardless of your method. The same test cases as the ones come with the challenge in `test.py` will be used upon your submission. 

Your code will be run using Python 3.7.0 with no third-party library installed. All challenges can be solved without importing any library. 


Remember, when in doubt, look at Python documentation. 

Good luck, and have fun.
