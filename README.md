# CPU Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the Choate Programming Union Coding Challenge. The purpose of this challenge is for you to gain an insight of your understanding of computational thinking ideology as well as your familiarity with language Python. We recognize that it is hard for us to go in depth during weekly meetings due to the time constraints, so we have carefully curated the challenges to motivate you to learn through programming communities outside Choate such as Stackoverflow. Independent online researching skills are crucial for you as a programmer, we hope to train these skills through this programming challenge. 

There are two parts of the challenge, Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. You may complete both of them if you want, but you may only choose one part of the challenge to submit upon completion. There is, of course, a prize associated with the completion of all challenges.

- Functional Programming
	- 10 questions
	- designed for beginners
	- 1 attendance point will be awarded if your code pass at least 6 test cases
	- 2 attendance points will be awarded if your code pass all 10 test cases (does not stack with previous one)
- Object Oriented Programming
	- 9 levels
	- designed for advanced programmers
	- 3 attendance points will be awarded if you complete at least 6 levels
	- 9 attendance points will be awarded if your code pass all 50 test cases (does not stack with previous one)
	- the first person who completes the challenge will recieve an additional $20 award
	- the second person who completes the challenge will recieve an additional $10 award
	- the third person who completes the challenge will recieve an additional $5 award

If you are not familiar with the concept of our attendance point system, here is the general outline:

- You get 1 attendance point for each club meeting you attend
- You may get 1-2 bonus attendance points for a particular club meeting, determined at the sole discretion of CPU cabinet.
- At the end of the year, you will receive a bluecard as a member of CPU if you have at least 5 attendance points
- At the end of the year, you will receive a bluecard as an officer of CPU if you have at least 18 attendance points
- Some minor adjustments may be applied to previous two rules based on the number of meetings we have of the school year.
- You need to have a Discord account to acquire attendance point.

## Submission
The challenge will be available at December 4, 6:30 p.m. It will be open until the first club meeting after the winter break. 

You may work on the challenge for however long you want. When you believe that you have done your best on the challenge, send your code (`functional_challenge.py` or `oop_challenge.py`) to `pkqxdd#1358` on Discord or `jwang20@choate.edu`. If you choose to submit via email, you should use `CPU Coding Challenge Submission` as your email subject. You may submit your code only **once**.

## Test Cases

The only measurement on how well you have performed in this challenge are the the number of test cases you passed, regardless of your method. The same test cases as the ones that come with the challenge in `test.py` will be used upon your submission. 

Your code will be run using Python 3.7.0 with no third-party library installed. All challenges can be solved without importing any libraries. 

You can run the test cases by 

```sh
cd oop_challenge
python3 .
```
or 
```sh
cd functional_challenge
python3 .
```
depending on which challenge you choose to take part in. The program is tested only with Python 3.7. However, it should work with Python 3.3+.

## Cooperations

You may help others debug their programs. However, you should not discuss with other students on how to approach each individual challenge. If you are really stuck, you can ask for help in `#help` channel of our Discord server. A club leader will answer your question.

We really spent a lot of time developing this challenge so please respect our efforts. We hope you will learn something new  by doing this challenge.

Remember, when in doubt, look at Python documentation. 

Good luck, and have fun.
